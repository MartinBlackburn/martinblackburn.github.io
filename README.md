# [martin.blackburn.dev](https://martin.blackburn.dev)

My personal website, [https://martin.blackburn.dev](https://martin.blackburn.dev), built in react.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. This gets built to a `docs` folder, so that it can be published on GitHub Pages without having to make a new branch.

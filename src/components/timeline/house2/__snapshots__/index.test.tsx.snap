          We got pretty lucky and a house came up not too long after we lost the last one. After a little bidding war we won! Although it was £40,000 over asking this time, eeek.
        </p>
        <p>
          They already have an house offer accepted, a new build, but we do have to wait until august for that to be completed.

          The mortgage was rejected, they didn't think the house was worth our offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mortgage broker said this has happened a lot recently with this particular mortgage provider and we should try another.

          The mortgage was rejected with another lender. Uh oh.
        </p>
        <p>
          We now have two options, make up the difference ourselves (£40,000), or negotiate the price.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seller has refused to reduce the price, so we agreed to make up the difference so long as the survey came back ok.
        </p>

          Not good news, the survey listed several major issues, roof replacement, conservatory replacement, penetrating damp on the first floor, rising damp on the ground floor, a crack in the external wall, plus a few other smaller issues.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we have sent the survey to the seller and have said that we are reducing our offer based on the work needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          After several quotes, the work looks like it could be anywhere from £20,000 to £60,000 to do.

          Price reduction

        <p>
          With a lot of back and forth, we ended up with a £25,500 price reduction. This also reduces our stamp duty bill by £1,275. So a total of £26,775 saved that we can use towards repairs. Hopefully enough to cover most of the work needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          It does mean we are still paying £15,000 over the value of the house, but as it's a house for life, we feel that it's worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may not be able to do all the repairs/decorating we wanted in one go due to the cost. However, the discount will allow us to do the major ones, such as the roof replacement and fix the damp problems.

          Turns out the seller was married after buying the house. So the title deeds with land registry don't reflect her current name. I thought this would have been a basic thing they should have checked at the start, but hey!
        </p>
        <p>
          So the seller will need to update land registry before we can carry on with the purchase.

          Actually no, it's full of mistakes and so need to have them amended. Obvious mistakes too, like: the wrong purchase price, wrong stamp duty amount, wrong address for my contact details to name a few.

        After many many house viewings, we finally got an offer accepted - Â£35,000 over asking price!
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we just have to wait for them to find a house they want to move to, while we get our paperwork in order, mortgage, surveys, etc.

        A little back and forth with the mortgage provider with some proof of identity and other documents and we finally have our mortgage approved.

        The seller has found a house and had their offer accepted, even better news is that there is no onward chain, so it will be a fairly simple process.

        The seller has decide that their onward purchase wasn't right for them, and so have pulled out. This means we are now waiting for them to find a new house.

        The seller has found another house and had their offer accepted, also with no chain. Hopefully this will be the end of our waiting.

        Back to waiting, as they decided to pull out of their onward purchase as they didn't like the people who were servicing the property.

      <p>
        Our mortgage offer expired today, as its been 6 months, so we have to re-apply. Nothing complicated, and it was approved the same day based on our old application.

      <p>
        The seller has decided the whole process is too stressful and have decided not to sell their house, so we are back to viewings again.
      </p>
      <p>
        So thats just over 8 months gone - thankfully we did start keeping an eye out for other properties. Unfortunately, we didn't see anything we liked as much so didn't make offers. Hindsight is a brutal thing.

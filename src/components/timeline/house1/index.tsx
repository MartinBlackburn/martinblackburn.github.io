                    Now we just have to wait for them to find a house they want to move to, while we get our paperwork
                    in order, mortgage, surveys, etc.

                    A little back and forth with the mortgage provider with some proof of identity and other documents
                    and we finally have our mortgage approved.

                <p>
                    The seller has found a house and had their offer accepted, even better news is that there is no
                    onward chain, so it will be a fairly simple process.

                    The seller has decide that their onward purchase wasn't right for them, and so have pulled out. This
                    means we are now waiting for them to find a new house.

                <p>
                    As it has been 6 months since our mortgage offer, it has now expired, so we have to re-apply.
                    Nothing complicated, and it was approved the same day based on our old application, but we've
                    decided to keep an eye out for other properties as this is taking a long time.

                <p>
                    The seller has decided the whole process is too stressful and have decided not to sell their house,
                    so we are back to viewings again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So thats just over 8 months gone - thankfully we did start keeping an eye out for other properties.
                    Unfortunately, we didn't see anything we liked as much so didn't make offers. Hindsight is a brutal
                    thing.
